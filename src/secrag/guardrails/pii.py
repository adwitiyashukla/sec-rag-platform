"""PII redaction.

Applied to model output rather than to the corpus. Redacting at ingestion would
destroy legitimate content, since filings contain company phone numbers and
addresses by regulatory requirement. Redacting at the boundary catches the case
that actually matters: a value that reaches a user or a log.

Patterns are deliberately conservative. A false positive here silently corrupts
a real figure in an answer, which is worse than the leak it was guarding
against, so anything ambiguous is left alone.
