"""Gradio front end for the Hugging Face Space.

Hugging Face made Docker Spaces a paid feature, so the free tier is Gradio or
Static only. The FastAPI service in `secrag.api` remains the primary interface
and is what the Docker image and the local `secrag serve` command run. This
module is a second front end over the same engine, not a reimplementation:
every number it shows comes from the same `QueryEngine` call path that the API
and the CLI use.

The Space ships a prebuilt index rather than ingesting on boot. Free Spaces
have no persistent disk, so ingesting at startup would re-download nine 10-K
filings from EDGAR on every restart, take about five minutes, and greet the
first visitor with an empty corpus.

# sec-rag-platform

**Evaluation-driven retrieval-augmented generation over SEC 10-K filings.**

Hybrid retrieval across dense and lexical arms, fused by Reciprocal Rank Fusion and reranked.
Financial figures are **computed from filed XBRL data rather than generated by the model**,
and every answer is verified against the passages it cites before being returned.
